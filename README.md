AdaptiveSegue
===========

Project to demonstrate code in article: http://coding.tabasoft.it/ios/adaptive-transition-in-ios8/

To demonstrare the diffrent scenario, use the following:

- the Main.storyboard has for lines for 4 different cases, move the RootViewController arrow to test different cases:
    1) Inside Navigation
    2) Isolated
    3) Detail of Split
    4) Master of split
- To test Split collapsed use iPhone simulator, to test Split expanded use iPad simulator (better in landscape because master popover navigation is not implemented)
